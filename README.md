## Abstract
Current methods of diagnosis for Alzheimer’s disease are often expensive and inaccurate. A novel blood-based diagnostic method was developed using the L-arginine metabolite cycle. This was investigated as a potential source of biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease using statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. This diagnostic tool could be utilized in the medical field to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease in an expedient and effective fashion.

## Methodologies Used
### Statistics (via base R)
* Shapiro-Wilk Test

### Visualizations (via ggplot2)
* Boxplots
* Density plots
* Violin plots
* Heatmaps

### Machine learning (via caret)
* CART decision tree
* K-nearest neighbor
* Random forest
* Logistic regression
* Fast and frugal
* Support vector machines
